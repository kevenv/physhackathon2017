# physhackathon2017
SimWave is a web application built for simulating the propogation of physical waves from multiple sources.

## Dependencies
All required javascript libraries are included in the [libs](https://github.com/kevenv/physhackathon2017/tree/master/libs) folder.
## Parameters
For our wave simulator, there are multiple parameters which users could modify in read-time simulation.

### Wave parameters 
1. alptitude: the apltitude of source wave.
2. frequency: the frequncy of the source wave.
3. WaveSpeed: speed of the wave.
4. DampingSpeed: damping coefficient.
5. dt: the delta time of each computing step.
### Plot parameters
1: color_peak: color of peak points.
2: color_bot: color of bottom points.
### Source parameters
1: x,y: coordinates of the sound source in (x, y) plane.
2: phase: the initial phase of the source.
